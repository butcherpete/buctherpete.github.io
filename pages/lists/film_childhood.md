I always liked old movies. Even when I was a kid, I had a thing for older black-and-white films. Movies that I remember watching as a kid that had a big influence on me.

This is a list of movies that had a huge influence on me when I was a child. I watched all of these movies before we moved to the ranch in Byron in 1974. 

## King Kong (1933)

## Gunga Din (1939)

## The Lemon Drop Kid (1951)

## It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  (1963)

## Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)

Ultraman was very important to us. My brother and myself and Paul and his brother Mark. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, Gamera, and Ultraman. And Ghidorah, who for some reason, we all knew as Monster X. I think we'd seen all of the Japanese monster movies several times and they all tended to blend into one another. I have a great deal trouble remember the different plots.  But Monster X, that was something different, that movie really stood out. 

## Lady in a Cage (1964)

My cousin Terri let me stay up late one night when she was baby sitting us and she was watching this movie and, of course, I watched it too... and it *really wigged me out man*.

## The Naked Prey (1965)

This one's for your lizard brain.

This movie snuck into my subconscious and stuck for many years. The plot was very vague to me, I couldn't remember the details. All I could remeber was that there was this white running from some black men. And there were snakes. Lot's of snakes and fire.  It's one for the lizard brain. There really isn't much to

For many years I was afraid to rewatch this movie. I was afraid that it wouldn't be as good. I watched it again and it wasn't as good. But over the next few weeks it kept creeping into my dreams and further I got away from it the better the movie became.   Only two movies in my experience can do that. The Naked Prey and Bring Me the Head of Afredo Garcia. They're ok to watch every now and again, never as good as you remember, but then for weeks afterwards, they slowly start taking over.

## That Darn Cat (1965)

I remember seeing this at a theatre in a mall. I believe it was in Concord, California and I remember they were selling copies of the record album in the lobby. I really, really wanted a copy of that record.

## Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)

Honestly, I don't know the first time I ever actually watched this entire movie. It certainly wasn't on my first attempt. We went to the Bridgehead drive-in in Antioch for this one. I flipped out when the German kid got fell into the chocolate river and got sucked up to tube. Just as my parents managed to get me settled and back into my seat, they were in the tunnel and somebody chopped the head off a chicken. 

I hid in the back of the station wagon hiding under a blanket. I refused to take any more of it.

## American Graffiti (1973)

I saw this movie at the drive-in with my parents, the Bridgehead again. For many years I believed that this movie was about my mother's class. She graduated from Modesto High in 1960. The film, of course, is about the class of 62. But no matter. The point is I thought that this was a movie about my parents youth.  That is more or less what I was told and what I believed.

Much of my childhood in the 1970s was spent watching my parents relive their own childhoods. After American Graffiti, there was a constant stream of "50's" nostaglia from Happy Days to Grease to that godawful Sha Na Na television series. When I was a kid, the Superman and Mickey Mouse Club television series were still on the TV every day after school.
